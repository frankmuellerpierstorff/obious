            <h2>Liability for content</h2>
            <p>The content on these pages was created with great care. However, I cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness or timeliness of the information provided. As a service provider, I am responsible for my own content pursuant to § 7(1) TMG. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, I am not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored external information or to investigate circumstances indicating illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. Liability is only possible from the moment a specific infringement becomes known. If I become aware of any such violations, I will remove the content immediately.</p>

            <h2>Liability for links</h2>

The respective provider or operator is always responsible for the linked pages. At the time of linking, the pages were checked for possible legal violations. No unlawful content was identifiable. Permanent monitoring of linked pages is not reasonable without concrete indications of a violation. If such content becomes known, I will remove the links immediately.</p>
